<h1>The Luck of the Fryrish</h1> <p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Ow, my spirit! Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?</p> <h2>A Flight to Remember</h2> <p>Ow, my spirit! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? No, I'm Santa Claus!</p> <ul> <li>You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?</li> <li>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</li> </ul> <h3>Where the Buggalo Roam</h3> <p>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Really?! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p> <h4>The Route of All Evil</h4> <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. Why would I want to know that? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&hellip; also, comes with double prize money. Say it in Russian! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. We don't have a brig.</p> <ol> <li>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li> <li>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</li> <li>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</li> </ol> <h5>The Mutants Are Revolting</h5> <p>Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Why not indeed! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Say it in Russian! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</p>
